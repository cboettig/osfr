## Overview

osfr provides a suite of functions for interacting with [OSF][osf] (<https://osf.io>) that are primarily focused on project management workflows.

**What is OSF?**

*OSF is a free and [open source][osf-gh] project management repository designed to support researchers across their entire project lifecycle. The service includes unlimited cloud storage and file version history, providing a centralized location for all your research materials that can be kept private, shared with select collaborators, or made publicly available with citable DOIs.*

## Installation

This package is currently under development and is not available on CRAN. You can install the current version with the *remotes* package:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("centerforopenscience/osfr")
```

## Usage Examples

*Note: You need to [setup an OSF personal access token (PAT)][auth] to use osfr to manage projects or upload files.*

### Accessing Open Research Materials

Many researchers use OSF to archive and share their work. You can use osfr to explore publicly accessible projects and download the associated files---all you need to get started is the project's URL or GUID (global unique identifier).

Every user, project, component, and file on OSF is assigned a GUID that is embedded in the corresponding entity's URL. For example, you can access the main OSF project for the *Cancer Reproducibility Project* at <https://osf.io/e81xl/>. The GUID for this project is `e81xl`.

We can then use osfr to *retrieve* this project and load it into R by providing the GUID:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(osfr)

cr_project <- osf_retrieve_node("e81xl")
cr_project
```

This returns an `osf_tbl` object with a single row representing the retrieved project. Let's list the files that have been uploaded to this project.

```{r}
osf_ls_files(cr_project)
```

This returns another `osf_tbl` with 1 row for each of the files and directories in the project. We can examine any of these files directly on OSF with `osf_open()`, which opens the corresponding file's view in your default browser.

This project contains 2 ***components***: *Replication Studies* and *Data collection and publishing guidelines*. We can list these components with osfr using `osf_ls_nodes()`.

```{r}
osf_ls_nodes(cr_project)
```

osfr is compatible with the [pipe operator][magrittr] and [dplyr][], providing a powerful set of tools for working with `osf_tbl`s. Here, we're listing the sub-components nested within the *Replication Studies* component, filtering for a specific study ([*Study 19*](https://osf.io/7zqxp/)) and then listing the files uploaded to that study's component.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

cr_project %>%
  osf_ls_nodes() %>%
  filter(name == "Replication Studies") %>%
  osf_ls_nodes(pattern = "Study 19") %>%
  osf_ls_files()
```

We could continue this pattern of exploration and even download local copies of project files using `osf_download()`.

### Managing Projects

You can use osfr to [create projects][osf-create], [add sub-components][osf-create] or [directories][osf-mkdir], and [upload files][osf-upload]. See [Getting Started][getting-started] to learn more about building projects with osfr, but here is a quick example in which we:

1. Create a new project called *Motor Trend Car Road Tests*
2. Create a sub-component called *Car Data*
3. Create a directory named *rawdata*
4. Upload a file (`mtcars.csv`) to the new directory
5. Open the uploaded file on OSF

```{r eval=FALSE}
# create an external data file
write.csv(mtcars, "mtcars.csv")

osf_create_project(title = "Motor Trend Car Road Tests") %>%
  osf_create_component("Car Data") %>%
  osf_mkdir("rawdata") %>%
  osf_upload("mtcars.csv") %>%
  osf_open()
```

## Details on `osf_tbls`

There are 3 main types of OSF entities that osfr can work with:

1. **nodes:** both [projects][help-proj] and [components][help-comp] (i.e., sub-projects) are referred to as nodes
2. **files:** this includes both files *and* folders stored on OSF
3. **users:** individuals with OSF accounts

osfr represents these entities within `osf_tbl`s---specialized data frames built on the tibble class that provide useful information about the entities like their `name` and unique `id` for users, and API data in the `meta` column that's necessary for osfr's internal functions. Otherwise, they're just `data.frames` and can be manipulated using standard functions from base R or dplyr.

## Acknowledgments

OSF is developed by the [Center for Open Science][cos] in Charlottesville, VA.

The original version of osfr was developed by [Chris Chartgerink][chris] and further developed by [Brian Richards][brian] and [Ryan Hafen][ryan]. The current version was developed by [Aaron Wolen][aaron] and is *heavily* inspired by [Jennifer Bryan][jenny] and [Lucy D'Agostino McGowan][lucy]'s excellent [googledrive][] package. Seriously, we borrowed a lot of great ideas from them. Other important resources include [http testing](https://ropensci.github.io/http-testing-book/) by Scott Chamberlain and [R Packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz) by Hadley Wickham. Development was also greatly facilitated by OSF's excellent [API documentation][osf-api].

Big thanks to Rusty Speidel for designing our logo and [Tim Errington][tim] for his feedback during development.
